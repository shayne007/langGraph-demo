I notice you're encountering an issue with Python package installation in a system-managed Python environment. The error suggests that you're trying to install packages globally, which is not recommended. Let's set up a proper virtual environment first:

1. First, create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Now install the dependencies using `uv` in the virtual environment:
```bash
pip3 install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This approach will:
1. Create an isolated Python environment for your project
2. Avoid conflicts with system Python packages
3. Keep your project dependencies clean and manageable
4. Allow you to use `uv` for faster package installation

The error you're seeing is due to PEP 668, which prevents accidental modifications to system Python installations. Using a virtual environment is the recommended way to handle Python package management.

After setting up the virtual environment, you can verify the installation by running:
```bash
python3 -c "import langgraph; print(langgraph)"
```

Remember to:
- Always activate the virtual environment (`.venv`) when working on this project
- Add `.venv/` to your `.gitignore` file if you're using version control
- Use `deactivate` command when you want to exit the virtual environment

        
To run the test:

1. Make sure you're in your virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
 ```

2. Run the test script:
```bash
python3 test_chat.py
 ```

This test script will:

1. Import your compiled graph from chat_robot.py
2. Create an initial message
3. Run the graph with the message
4. Print the bot's response
5. Continue the conversation with a follow-up message
6. Print the second response
